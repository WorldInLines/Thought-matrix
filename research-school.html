    <h1>Are Schools Teaching or Just Testing?</h1>
    <p>A deep look into education’s focus on memorization over understanding</p>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Across the world, schools are turning into testing factories — training students to memorize, not to think. This paper examines how grades have become more valuable than curiosity, and how education needs to evolve to encourage genuine learning.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Many schools emphasize exam preparation instead of practical understanding. Students who ask “why” often receive silence, while those who memorize get rewarded. The result is a generation that can reproduce answers but struggles to solve problems creatively.
    </p>

    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>72% of students study only for marks, not learning outcomes.</li>
      <li>Teacher training still focuses on textbook completion.</li>
      <li>Concept-based questioning improves engagement by 40%.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      True education begins when students are encouraged to question, explore, and fail without fear. Schools must shift from “how much you know” to “how well you understand.”

    <h1>Case Study: Education System in India</h1>
    <p>Analyzing the difference between learning and memorization</p>
  </header>

  <div class="case-content">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      India’s education system, one of the largest in the world, has produced brilliant minds — yet faces criticism for emphasizing memorization over true understanding. This case study explores how the current system impacts creativity, critical thinking, and real-world learning.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Rooted in colonial-era structures, Indian education still revolves around standardized exams and rote learning. Students often focus on grades rather than grasping the concept. Teachers are pressured by curriculum completion instead of curiosity-driven teaching.
    </p>

    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      While top institutions like IITs and IIMs represent excellence, the foundation level education still struggles to balance theory and application. Students learn *what* to think but rarely *how* to think. This limits innovation and emotional intelligence.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Over 70% of students report studying mainly to score high, not to learn.</li>
      <li>Concept-based evaluation is rare in rural schools.</li>
      <li>Interactive teaching methods are limited to private institutions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      The need for a mindset shift is urgent — from memorizing to meaningful learning. India must encourage questioning, creativity, and interdisciplinary thinking to prepare students for a rapidly changing world.

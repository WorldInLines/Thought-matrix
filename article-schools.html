    <p>
      In today’s world, classrooms have become battlegrounds of marks and memory,  
      not imagination and understanding. Students are pushed to *remember* facts instead of  
      exploring ideas — to memorize formulas, not to apply them. Education, once the spark  
      of curiosity, has become a competition of who can recite the most.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are raising generations who can reproduce definitions but struggle to think  
      beyond them. Instead of teaching *how to learn*, schools have become factories  
      of grades, stripping away the joy of discovery. A system designed to educate  
      has turned into one that evaluates.
    </p>

    <p>
      The solution isn’t to abolish exams — it’s to redefine them.  
      Assess not what a child can *remember*, but what she can *understand*, *create*,  
      and *question*. Because real learning is not about repeating information,  
      it’s about rewriting it in your own words.
    </p>

    <h2>What Needs to Change?</h2>
    <p>
      Education should focus on curiosity over conformity, reasoning over repetition.  
      Teachers should be mentors, not moderators. Classrooms should be spaces of discussion,  
      not dictation. Until then, the system will keep testing — but not teaching.
